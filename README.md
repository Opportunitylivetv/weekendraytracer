# Ray tracing in One Weekend: In Rust ðŸ’«

Working through Peter Shirley's book
[Ray tracing in One Weekend](http://in1weekend.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html),
I recommend it if you're looking to learn something new.

For fun, this is a library with buildable examples for each chapter.  But,
build your own using the book, it's well worth it.
